Sell your NFT by creating an auction
An NFT auction is like a digital art sale where people bid on unique digital items, like artwork or collectibles, over the internet. The seller sets a starting price and a time limit. Bidders place their offers, and when the time's up, the highest bid wins the NFT. It's a modern twist on traditional auctions but for digital treasures.
